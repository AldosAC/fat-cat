### Fat Cat

Fat Cat is the Alexa skill for fact checking your fat cat.  Think your girlfriend fed your cat this morning, but your cat's acting like it hasn't eaten in a week?  Fat Cat can help get to the bottom of it.

## Installation

While fat cat is in development the best way to install and try the app is by using the Alexa Developer Console and creating a new custom project.  Then copy and paste the link to this repo to import the code and you should be good to launch it in the test environment on the Alexa Developer Console.

I'll update the Readme with clearer instructions soon.
